This project outlines the development of a sophisticated digital solution that centralizes supplier management, leverages advanced analytics and Agentic AI, and provides an intuitive interface for strategic decision-making.

## 4. Problem Statement
The current supplier management practices within Walmart face several critical impediments:

* **Suboptimal Supplier and Product Performance Analysis:** A lack of granular, real-time insights into the performance of individual products and suppliers at a specific store level. Existing systems struggle to identify root causes of issues like stockouts, defects, or spoilage, hindering targeted interventions.
* **Reactive Issue Resolution:** Without an intelligent system for proactive identification of risks and failures, responses to supplier-related problems are often reactive, leading to increased costs, reduced product availability, and diminished customer satisfaction.
* **Inefficient Alternative Supplier Identification:** The process of finding and evaluating alternative suppliers is often manual and lacks a data-driven approach to identify those with higher potential based on specific store-level issues (e.g., profitability, sustainability, quality).
* **Limited Visualization of Complex Relationships:** The intricate web of relationships between stores, suppliers, products, and performance metrics is difficult to visualize and understand, impeding effective network optimization.
* **Challenges in Dynamic Optimization:** The inability to dynamically adjust supplier networks based on changing parameters (e.g., market demand shifts, new sustainability goals) leads to static and less efficient supply chains.

These issues collectively impact Walmart's operational efficiency, financial performance, and ability to meet its strategic objectives for local sourcing and environmental responsibility.

## 5. Project Vision and Goals
